# Website
The Website was created for my Web Development Module.


I was asked to develop a website to promote one of multiple topics.

The Website had to contain at least 5 pages with relevant content on each, it also had to include 3 external links to other websites related to the chosen topic.
Additionally, The Website also had to adhere to the HTML5 standard and must be implemented using CCS (which can be located in a separate file)

In order for me to meet all the critera, I used software such as Visual Studio Code to develop the CSS and HTML. Visual Studio Code was difficult to use at the start of the project as I had no knowledge of how to use it, however it became easier the more research I did on its features etc.

I also used free licensed websites to find images that linked to the chosen topic. However, this could prove difficult at times due to the images that I wanted could not be found.

In order to look at this project, you can extract the ZIP File onto software such as Visual Studio Code and run it.

The website has many options and buttons to click on to navigate you through the pages smoothly. The design is basic but also professional, I did this so that the user is not confused.

In the Main Branch, there is also a documentation that explains my thought process of the design and the development of the project and how I found the module/assignment overall.

Enjoy the Website!
